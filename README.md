# DiscordPoweruser


- [ ] Get all the user names + user ids and save them in a json file, where the filename is the name of the server
{id:"some id", name:"some name"}
- [ ]  

## Goal

- Make a list with all Discord users
- Automate sending them a message 

How can I auto send a message on discord?

This only does make sense to develop if I am also able to send automated messages 

My goal is to ask a lot of people about an opinion. So the first question I would like to ask people is if the chess people would like to have an app where they get game annotations. Depending on the feedback I can proceed with my chess coach.

First I need to achieve sending a message from my wobbert acount to yachty. if this works out i can do it more broadly.

I want to iterate 

i imagine a python script which takes one argument, the server name and than puts all the data into sheet
